# Congratulations!

You've installed Neato succesfully! You're now free to start developing your app with no worries about your build step :sunglasses:

### What Now?

Just run `npm run neato:dev` and you're good to go! Also, feel free to alias the neato commands with your own scripts (eg. `npm run start => npm run neato:dev` or `npm run compile => npm run neato:deploy`)!

If you want to see an example Neato repo, check out the [React example]
