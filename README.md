# WARNING!

I'm currently changing the entire structure/purpose of this project. It's being changed from boilerplate code you clone to a module you install via npm. [More information can be found here].

# Neato
An app performance-enhancing drug that's pretty neat because of the way it is.

### About Neato

Neato is a module you install at your project's start. It adds a bunch of the wiring up you usually do when making a modern React-based web app, including your build system, development server, client-side routing, etc. It's super configurable, too!

### Planned Features

You can see [all issues with the `planned-feature` label here].

### Why No Issues or Pull Requests on GitHub?
I prefer to do most of my OSS stuff on [GitLab]. In fact, the repo there mirrors to GitHub, so it's the source of truth. I have it on GitHub solely because it seems like the target audience for this project most likely has a GitHub account over a GitLab account.

Having to track issues and pull requests from two different places seems pretty hard to manage, so I ask you submit [issues] or [pull-requests] on [the GitLab project page]

[GitLab]: https://gitlab.com
[issues]: https://gitlab.com/seanclayton/neato/issues
[pull-requests]: https://gitlab.com/seanclayton/neato/merge_requests
